Home Value Insights: A Beginner's Regression Dataset
This dataset is designed for beginners to practice regression problems, particularly in the context of predicting house prices. It contains 1000 rows, with each row representing a house and various attributes that influence its price. The dataset is well-suited for learning basic to intermediate-level regression modeling techniques.

>Features:
Square_Footage: The size of the house in square feet. Larger homes typically have higher prices.
Num_Bedrooms: The number of bedrooms in the house. More bedrooms generally increase the value of a home.
Num_Bathrooms: The number of bathrooms in the house. Houses with more bathrooms are typically priced higher.
Year_Built: The year the house was built. Older houses may be priced lower due to wear and tear.
Lot_Size: The size of the lot the house is built on, measured in acres. Larger lots tend to add value to a property.
Garage_Size: The number of cars that can fit in the garage. Houses with larger garages are usually more expensive.
Neighborhood_Quality: A rating of the neighborhoodâ€™s quality on a scale of 1-10, where 10 indicates a high-quality neighborhood. Better neighborhoods usually command higher prices.
House_Price (Target Variable): The price of the house, which is the dependent variable you aim to predict.


>Potential Uses:
Beginner Regression Projects: This dataset can be used to practice building regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests. The target variable (house price) is continuous, making this an ideal problem for supervised learning techniques.

Feature Engineering Practice: Learners can create new features by combining existing ones, such as the price per square foot or age of the house, providing an opportunity to experiment with feature transformations.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): You can explore how different features (e.g., square footage, number of bedrooms) correlate with the target variable, making it a great dataset for learning about data visualization and summary statistics.

Model Evaluation: The dataset allows for various model evaluation techniques such as cross-validation, R-squared, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These metrics can be used to compare the effectiveness of different models.

<Versatility:>
The dataset is highly versatile for a range of machine learning tasks. You can apply simple linear models to predict house prices based on one or two features, or use more complex models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting Machines to understand interactions between variables.

It can also be used for dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA or to practice handling categorical variables (e.g., neighborhood quality) through encoding techniques like one-hot encoding.

This dataset is ideal for anyone wanting to gain practical experience in building regression models while working with real-world features
